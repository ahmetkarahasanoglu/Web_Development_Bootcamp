// We're referring it "Object Literal". Because, the term "object" pops up from almost everywhere in javascript. For example:
// myArray[]  --> this is an object in javascript. And an "Object Literal" is this:
myObject = {
    color: "red" ,
    condition: "good"
};

const person = {  // We can use "const" for objects also, just like in arrays. So, we can change the content of a constant object, but we cannot change the shell (the whole object). (we cannot assign a new object to "person").
    firstName   : "Mick" ,
    lastName    : "Jagger" ,
};
