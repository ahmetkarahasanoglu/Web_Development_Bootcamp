COMMON PATTERNS FOR UPDATING ARRAYS IN STATE (important):
--> 00_ Teacher's Code / src / commonArrayPatterns.js

* '-->When updating arrays in State, we have to use methods that doesn't change the original array. For example, we can't use pop(), but instead we should use filter.

----------------------------------------
For primitive types (variables that hold number, boolean etc.), React knows when they go through a change (useState perceives it). But for arrays and objects, React cannot perceive when their content change. So, we handle this by using a copy of the array:

const [emojis, setEmojis] = useState([":)"]);
    const addEmoji = () => {        
        setEmojis((...oldEmojis) => [...oldEmojis, ";p"]);
    }
