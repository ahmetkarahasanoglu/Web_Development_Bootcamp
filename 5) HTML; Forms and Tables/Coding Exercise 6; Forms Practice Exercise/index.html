<!-- FORMS PRACTICE EXERCISE
Let's get some practice with forms, inputs, labels, and buttons! Write a simple form with the following inputs:
    Username
        Text Input
        Should have placeholder text of 'username'
        Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)
    Password
        Password Input
        Should have placeholder text of 'password'
        Make sure to properly label the input (using id/for attributes)
    A Button
        With the inner text 'Register'

I added in some <div> elements for spacing, but you don't need to:
-->

<form>
    <label for="username">Username</label>
    <input type="text" placeholder="username" id="username">
    <br>
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <input type="password" placeholder="password" id="password">
    <br>
    <button>Register</button>
</form>
