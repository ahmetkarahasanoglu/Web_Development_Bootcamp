EMS:
1 em means exact the same size with the parent element. 2 em means twice the size of the parent element.
      NOTE: With font-size, 1 em equals to the font-size of the parent. 2 em's is twice the font-size of the parent etc.
      With other properties, 1 em is equal to the computed font-size of the element itself.

--- REMS (root ems): ----
Relative to the root html element's font-size. Often easier to work with.
       If the root font-size is 20px, 1 rem is always 20px, 2 rem is always 40px etc.
