On Terminal, when we're in the directory that we're working, and when we install a package, it is installed locally; for example 'colors' package; the package will be installed in that directory under a folder named 'node_modules' folder (in the directory where we're at on terminal)

Generally, it is preferred to install packages locally. But it is possible to install globally as well:

> npm install -g cowsay  // installs cowsay package globally (on the global scope - in terms of the folders of files - about reaching of the files)

Info: if we encounter an error about permission of 'writing access' when we execute the above command, the error is: [npm WARN chekcPermissons Missing write access to /usr/local/lib/node_modules] --> this is the directory where global installations are kept. Then, use this line of command to change the permission:
> sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules   // chown means 'change ownership'

Write 'cowsay' in Terminal, it will show information about cowsay.
Write 'cowsay Hellooooo!' it will show the cow figure saying Hellooooo!.

If we want to use cowsay in a js file, e.g. index.js, write in that file:
const cowsay = require("cowsay");

Then, on Terminal, write:
> npm link cowsay  // to enable access to cowsay.
