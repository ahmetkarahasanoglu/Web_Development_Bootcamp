Specificity: the more specific command overwrites the other more general command.
Specificity is how the browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules could apply to the same element. It is a measure of how specific a given selector is. The more specific selector wins.

Specificiy priority: 1) Id  2) Class  3) Element.
An Id is extremely specific.

The calculation method of specificity: --- (the digits represent id, class, element. From left to right). For example: If there is only 1 element, the score is 001. If there is only 1 Id, the score is 100. So 100 wins over 001.

Case: - - -  vs. - - -
      0 0 28 vs. 0 1 0
In this case, 010 wins, it has more priority. Because 1 is higher than 0. (the second section of the numbers)(the middle).
