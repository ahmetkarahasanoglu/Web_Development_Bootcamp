Cascading Style Sheets. Cascade means one onto another. Now, if I write two h1 attribute description in the css file, the latter h1 one will overwrite the former. Also, this system is valid for file inclusion: when I write <link href="ahm_styles.css"> in html files' head section, and on one below line if I write <link href="more_styles.css">, and if the both files include some lines about for example h1, then the latter (more_styles.css) will overwrite. about this h1.
