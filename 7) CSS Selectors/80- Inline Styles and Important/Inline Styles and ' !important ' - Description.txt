Inline Styles: are the most specific; they are more specific than:* ID Selectors,  * Class, Attribute, & Pseudo Class Selectors,  * Element and Pseudo Element Selectors.

Inline Style means writing style inside the Html file. For example (in Html file):<button id="signup" style="color:red">Sign Up</button>

!!! Avoid using Inline Styles. They can cause confusion.

--------------------------------

Usage of  " !important " : it makes the command the most specific (super specific) one among other commands, and overwrites the other conflicting commands. Example:

.tag {
	color: red !important;
}

!!! Avoid using " !important " . Because it is against the nature of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Instead of using it, try to arrange the priorities by using CSS features: ID, class, or attribute etc.
