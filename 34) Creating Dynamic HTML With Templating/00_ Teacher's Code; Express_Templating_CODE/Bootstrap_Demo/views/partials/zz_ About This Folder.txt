This folder is about partials. EJS calls them 'includes'. It's a way of including templates in other templates. For example: if we're gonna use the <head> part in multiple files, we can store it in another directory and call it on the files where we need them (on the 'views' files).

SYNTAX FOR INCLUDING 'PARTIALS':
(pay att: we're using '<%-')
<%- include('partials/head')%>
<%- include('partials/navbar')%>

<%- include('partials/footer')%>
