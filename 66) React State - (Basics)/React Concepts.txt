Note: If you have a data that needs to change within a component, you need to use state.

- COMPONENTS: Building blocks of react. Combination of logic and presentation.
- PROPS: Data passed to a component. Immutable (doesn't change).
- STATE: Data specific to an instance of a components. Can change.

WHAT GOES IN STATE?:
- Data fetched from an API.
- Form information.
- A variable that "decides" whether sth is showing or hidden.
- Ask yourself: "Will this ever change?" If so, it should go in state somewhere!
----
useState() is a React method. It's used like this: (array destructuring is used):
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  --> for a counter that starts from 0.
'useState()' returns an array containing two elements:
    - The piece of state itself,
    - A function to change the piece of state.
You must call useState INSIDE a component.
