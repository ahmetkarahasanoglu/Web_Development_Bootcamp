Semantic markup words don't change anything in the html, they don't change the function of that particular 
       tag that they're used in lieu of. For example: we can use a "nav" (navigation) instead of a "div". We can 
       use "section", we can use "footer" instead of a "div". This is only for giving meaning to that part of the code. 
       This is why it's called semantic (related to meaning). This is useful for: the code writer itself for a tidy code, 
       for google to search through the content of html. Or, for another code writer to see and understand easily the code.
       These elements are:
       <section>
       <article>
       <nav>
       <main>
       <header>
       <footer>
       <aside>
       <summary>
       <details>
