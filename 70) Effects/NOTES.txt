ABOUT 'useEffect':
* Can we do something after a render or re-render? Yes, we can. These are called 'side-effects' or 'effects'.
* Effects are used for: doing things after (& unrelated to) a render. This is useful for different kinds of things.
  - Changing parts of the DOM not covered by React.
  - Async operations, like AJAX requests when a component is mounted.
  - Doing things when a component is about to be unmounted.
