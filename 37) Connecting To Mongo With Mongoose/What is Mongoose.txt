Mongoose connects Mongo and NodeJS.

Mongoose enables us to control javascript code related to MongoDB, on terminal.

ODM (Object Data Mapper):
    ODMs like Mongoose map ('map' as a verb) documents coming from a database into usable JavaScript objects.
    Mongoose provides ways for us to model out our application data and define a schema. It offers easy ways to validate data and build complex queries from the comfort of JS.
