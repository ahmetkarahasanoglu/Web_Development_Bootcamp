The subject of this lesson is; the files of: MultiDiceRolls.js, MultiDiceRolls.css

* Instead of the 'class' keyword, in React we use 'className'.
Example: <h2 className = "title"> Hey! </h2>


USING CSS STYLES IN REACT:
- Make a component. Ex: MultiDiceRolls(){.... in the MultiDiceRolls.js
- Make a matching CSS file that has the same name.
- Import that CSS file in MultiDiceRolls.js.
- Give your components a 'className'.
- (by the way, in App.js, we need to import MultiDiceRolls.js.)
