TERMINAL: A TEXT-BASED INTERFACE TO YOUR COMPUTER. ORIGINALLY A PHYSICAL OBJECT, BUT NOW WE USE SOFTWARE TERMINALS.

AN ANALOGY: ATM is the terminal, the software running on the ATM is the shell.

BASH: One of the most popular shells (and the default on a Mac).


****** COMMANDS (IN TERMINAL) ******
ls: (List). Used to list the content of your current directory

pwd: (Print Working Directory). Prints the path to the working directory (where you currently are)

cd: (Change Directory). Change and move between folders.

cd .. : go back up one directory (there is a space character between 'cd' and '..')

touch: creates a file or multiple files. Ex: 'touch index.html' or 'touch index.html app.css app.js'

mkdir: (Make Directory). creates a new directory or directories.

rm: (Remove). Deletes a file or files. It permanently removes them!

rm-rf: deletes a directory (a folder) [r=recursive, f=force]

Tilde (~): when we see this, it means we're in the home directory.

----------------------------------
RELATIVE VS. ABSOLUTE PATH:
* This is relative directory:
   - cd downloads/New Folder
  This is also relative directory:
   - cd ../../Pets --> goes 2 folders back and enters into 'Pets' there.
* This is absolute directory:
  cd /Users/AH-PC/downloads/New Folder (pay attention to the '/' in the beginning [after cd])
  INFO: 
- cd / --> takes us to the Root directory 
- cd ~ --> takes us to the Home directory 

-------------------------------------
man: short for "manual".
- man ls --> gives me information about ls command.
  If it doesn't work on our terminal, we can also use:
- 'ls --help'  or  'pwd --help'  etc
------------------
FLAGS:
It is the letter we write after the command (ls or pwd etc). Example:
- 'ls -l' : list the items in long format (details like update time, permissions)
- 'ls -a' : show all the items including hidden files. Hidden files' name begin with a dot (.)
